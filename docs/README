Requirements:

To make use of Curo, you need to have:
1. psql (version 8.3 or later)
2. bash
3. dialog

Installation:

1. Copy curo directory to your home directory as .curo
2. If your psql is using readline, add to your ~/.inputrc this line:
$include ~/.curo/docs/readline.inputrc
3. If your psql is using libedit, copy ~/.curo/docs/libedit.editrc to your
   ~/.editrc
4. If you're unsure which library your psql is using, you can use:
   - ldd $( which psql )
   - or just do both steps - #2 and #3
5. It's done. F1-F8 keys in psql now give you access to Curo functionality

Curo content:

In ~/.curo/ directory there are following elements:
1. docs directory - contains readline/libedit configuration files plus some
   documentation
2. k directory - contains sql scripts which will be called when you press
   f1-f8 keys while in psql
3. s directory - this is where curo sql and shell scripts reside
4. c directory - common scripts used by action scripts from /s/

Scripts in k/ directory are overwritten by curo itself when you change
keybindings in setup screen, so changing them on your own is not good idea.
Instead you can add scripts in s/ and then set curo to call your script on
some f1-f8 keypress.

Troubleshooting:

While we do test Curo on our own, you might encounter problems that we
didn't stumbled upon. In such case - contact depesz@omniti.com for help.
